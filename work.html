		<h3>My Research Interests</h3>
		<p>
		<p>My research interest lies in Soft Condensed Matter and Biological Physics. I employ computer simulations and theoretical models 
			to study the physics of soft material systems. Furthermore, my research interest also involves the study 
			of flow properties of suspensions of macromolecules and colloids.</p> <br>
		<h2>Biological physics</h2>
		<p>Studying the physical and mechanical properties of biological systems has been of utmost important. During the time, 
			huge development has been done in its theoretical as well as experimental realizations. I am interested in applying 
			the theoretical models and computer simulations to study these complex systems (self-assembly of colloidal particles,
			protein aggregation, membrane dynamics, drug delivery, pattern formations through cell movement, mechanical properties 
			of tissues etc). </p>

		<h2>Active Jamming / active glass</h2>
		<p>Jamming in living matter and active synthetic systems is an emergent area of research that is under intense
			attention due to its relevance to diverse physical and biological systems. In particular, jamming in living cell
			tissues have been argued to be crucial to many important processes that include the development programme
			of organs in our body. From a physics standpoint, active systems, i.e., systems in which particulates can move
			by generating their own active forces, are intrinsically far from equilibrium. I am keen to understand the
			question of jamming in these far from equilibrium systems.</p>

		<h2>Polymer Physics</h2>
		<p>Studying the properties of a polymer under different circumstances has a very long history. During the time,
			huge depelopement has been done in its theoretical as well as experimental realisations. I employ theoretical
			models and computer simulations to study structure and dynamics of polymer chain under different physical conditions.</p>
		<h2>Active matter: Microswimmers and Swarms</h2>
		<p>Study of active particles is in immense interest in last few decades. These particles show very different and 
			emergent properties compared to particles in equilibrium. I study individual as well collective behaviour
			of anisotropic microswimmers, which also include the effect of fluid-flow on the system. I study collective
			behaviour of isotropic active particles also.</p>

				<li>Characteristic features of an active polar filament pushing a load, <br> P. Maurya*, <b> Shalabh K. Anand*# </b> 
					and Sunil P. Singh# <a href="https://scipost.org/SciPostPhys.18.6.189" target="_blank"> SciPost Physics,  18, 189 (2025) </a></li>
			</div>
		<h2>Active Colloids and Nonequilibrium Statistical Physics</h2>
		<p>Since the begining of active matter, motility induced phase separations (MIPS) has been in attention. My research
			interests also involve unraveling the insights of plethora of peculiar properties exhibited by a system of active colloids.
			The formulation of thermodynamic laws for the description of small-scale nonequilibrium systems in contact with
			heat and work reservoirs has deepened and extended our understanding of thermodynamics and its relation to
			microscopic laws in recent years. This novel connection has been made in various different contexts, including
			microscopic classical and quantum descriptions, mesoscopic descriptions embodied in stochastic thermodynamics.
			Study of fluctuation relations and heat dissipation in out-of-equilibrium systems also interests me.</p>
